/* The d_name field
    The dirent structure definition is taken from the
    glibc headers, and shows the d_name field with a fixed size.

    Warning: applications should avoid any dependence on the size of
    the d_name field.POSIX defines it as char d_name[], a character
    array of unspecified size, with at most NAME_MAX characters
    preceding the terminating null byte('\0').

    POSIX.1 explicitly notes that this field should not be used as an
    lvalue.The standard also notes that the use of sizeof(d_name)
    is incorrect; use strlen(d_name) instead.  (On some systems, this
    field is defined as char d_name[1]!)  By implication, the use
    sizeof(struct dirent) to capture the size of the record including
    the size of d_name is also incorrect.

    Note that while the call

    fpathconf(fd, _PC_NAME_MAX)

    returns the value 255 for most filesystems, on some filesystems
    (e.g., CIFS, Windows SMB servers), the null - terminated filename
    that is(correctly) returned in d_name can actually exceed this
    size.In such cases, the d_reclen field will contain a value
    that exceeds the size of the glibc dirent structure shown above.
